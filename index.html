            <p>Introduction to Programming Environment` is a subject that helps students to
               build a professional environment for coding and understanding some technical
               words used in everyday project development. We believe development must be an
                enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. IPE takes the pain out
                of development by easing common tasks used in many projects, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Code sharing for group project development.</li>
                <li>Code versioning for keeping changes under control.</li>
                <li>Code ownership by identifying who make any part of the code.</li>
