## About TP01 IPE
`Introduction to Programming Environment` is a subject that helps students to
build a professional environment for coding and understanding some technical
words used in everyday project development. We believe development must be an
enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. IPE takes the pain out
of development by easing common tasks used in many projects, such as:
- Code sharing for group project development.
- Code versioning for keeping changes under control.
- Code ownership by identifying who make any part of the code.
Version 1.0.0 I.P.E.
- Task management for dividing tasks for each team member.
## Code of Conduct
In order to ensure that everyone understand the subject, make sure everyone
complete every `Task Practice`.
